Our technology saved may lives that day. We saw The Messenger's army. We saw how the weapons were armed and targeted on the Citadel. They didn't believe us at first. They caught The Messenger halfway to its ship. The coward cracked. That was the only time it allowed its stinking self to be seen by any other than the Collector. It was our attack that destroyed the Citadel, that killed the fools for not listening, that killed The Messenger. 

We can only hope that his "protection" never got a proper lock on our position. 

There is nowhere to run.
