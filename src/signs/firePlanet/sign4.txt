The Messenger was not of the Collective. It was other, foreign, parasitic. It infected the Citadel with its promises of protection. The Messenger's own planet had been destroyed by an army from the stars. Its own people were made to flee by the fires of war. The Messenger was the scout sent to represent its people, the advance party, sent to warn us of the war that would surely reach us too. The Messenger offered protection. The army it brought was large. So then, what could we offer it in return? 

The Messenger knew about the Ultimate Weapon. The whole of Paxak flames when we think of who told it, who gave away the secret of our power. We may never know. But we watched the skies, and we waited for the mistake of The Messenger that would prove us right.
