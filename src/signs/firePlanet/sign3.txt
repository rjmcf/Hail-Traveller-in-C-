When we settled, in the origin days, we were promised justice for the good and justice for the bad. We would be left alone to our work and life as long as we followed their rules. They broke their own rules when they did not consult us about The Messenger. The threat was against us all, and they made their own decision. Had we not watched the skies, it would have cost us our lives, not just theirs. 

We don't often run. We're running now.
