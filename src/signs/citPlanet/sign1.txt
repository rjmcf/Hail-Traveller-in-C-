Hail Traveller! 

What you see before you is the mighty citadel, wherein dwell those who rule over the collective. This planet, imaginatively named Citadel, is used solely for meetings of the leaders of the collective, presided over by the High Collector.

The four planets that make up the collective all orbit around the same star as Citadel does. Each planet is sparsely populated, as the people require but a small amount of space for their population. Each planet is rich in resources, both that the people use in earnest, and those that they allow to lie untapped. 

Explore and discover! We will find rich pickings here!
